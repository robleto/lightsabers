Hello there ðŸ‘‹, thanks for visiting.

I've been a Star Wars fan since I was a kid, so I've had all my adulthood and much of my youth to be fascinated by the primary weapon of the Star Wars universe -- the lightsaber.  I started this project to sharpen by digital illustration skills and converted the art to SVGs and collected into this gallery so I could enjoy it online and make the web just a little more fun.
